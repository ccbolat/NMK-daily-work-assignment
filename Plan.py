# We will assign daily-tasks to groups every week. 
# This program does not remember what are assigned the last week. 
# Define the libraries you need.


# Define task lists of length 15, 20, 25, 30. 
# Define their weight lists using parameters. Weights should be w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4.
# And so we can change w_i's and test the result for different w_i's.
# w_1's are easy tasks for off days. We will add a constraint for that.



# Define the possible programs in the village. 
# Create two different types of each program. 
# One has an off day in the week, the other does not have. 
# OR Ask program name, number of groups, and off day of the program as an input and skip the following.



# Define off days of programs to assign easy tasks. 


 
# Merge the programs in an order and calculate n.



# Pick the first list whose length exceed n. 
# Delete unneccesary tasks from the list. 
# Define it as the main task list.



# Now we know task lists, programs and their numbers, off days of programs, easy tasks. 
# Do we need to know something else? 
# I think we can now define the objective function by using n, weights, and the main task list. 



# Define constraints.




# Construct Simulated Annealing and solve the problem.




# Convert your solution vector to a daily-task assignment of groups. 




# Print the task assignment as a table. Save the table.
