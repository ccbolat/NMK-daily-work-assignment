# We will assign daily-tasks to groups every week. 
# This program does not remember what are assigned the last week. 
# Define the libraries you need.


# Define task lists of length 15, 20, 25, 30. 
# Define their weight lists using parameters. Weights should be w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4.
# And so we can change w_i's and test the result for different w_i's.
# Define easy tasks for off days.


# Define the possible programs in the village. 
# Create two different types of each program. 
# One has an off day in the week, the other does not have. 


# Define off days of programs to assign easy tasks. 


# Ask the number of each program and save them. 
# Merge them in an order and calculate n.


# Pick the first list whose length exceed n. 
# Delete unneccesary tasks from the list. 
# Save it as the main task list.


# Now we know task lists, programs and their numbers, off days of programs, easy tasks. 
# Do we need to know something else? 
# I think we can now define the objective function by using n, weights, and the main task list. 



# Define constraints.



# Define Solution Method and solve the problem.



# Convert your solution vector to a daily-task assignment of groups. 



# Print the task assignment as a table. Save the table.
