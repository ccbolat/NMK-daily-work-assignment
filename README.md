# NMK-daily-work-assignment
Daily work at NMK is carried out by the participants. While the participants attend classes all day long in areas such as mathematics, art, philosophy, and theater, they perform tasks such as washing dishes, cleaning the toilet, helping with dinner, collecting garbage at certain hours.  We model an integer programming to form task groups.
